   ### Scope

   Within project conception, a list of features were compiled, these were the scored 
   between 1 & 5 for importance and feasibility/ viability which then decided which features 
   could be included for initial launch.    

   #### Current features 

-   Responsive on all device sizes

-   Accessible

-   Interactive elements

-   Social Links 

-   Contact form prefills the personal information for logged in users.

-   Changing nav menu and footer links and buttons in depending on the users log in status, admin status and what event if any they have added.

-   Able to search products for song, artist or album name.

-   Can search events for name of event, location or details.

-   'Back to top' footer link on each page, saves users from having to scroll up to Nav bar especially on mobile devices.

   #### Features to implement in the future

- 

### Structure

-   Created a database schema using [GraphizOnline](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/), as per Emmets     instructions on [slack](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C7HS3U3AP/p1642276160282900) see [here](/media/readme/db.png) to view better.

### Skeleton 

Wireframes were created on Balsamiq (see links below)

* [Mobile](/media/readme/mobilewf.png)
* [Tablet](/media/readme/tabletwf.png)
* [Desktop](/media/readme/desktopwf.png)

The finished project does differ a bit from the wireframes. There are less merchandise products per row on the page and I've changed the footer to better match the useful links. Also, on the profile page there is now the added functionality of seeing which news posts you like and going back to them. And on the news page, it is now more centered than left/right which is how I initially thought it would play out in the draft of wireframes.

### Surface

 -  #### Colour Scheme
    
    
    ![image showing color scheme](/media/readme/db.png)
        
-   #### Typography
         
    Used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to import the fonts used for this site. Specifically the 'Bebas Neue' font used throughout.
      
-   #### Imagery
    The images I've chosen were taken from Charli Xcx's current website and RedBubble. The news posts images were from the respective articles or performances, etc. I tried to pick the styles and images that coincide with the release of the new album and focus on promotion of that while also enhancing the style of the website. 

-   #### Design Choices

## Challenges 


## Testing

Testing and results can be found [here](TESTING.md)

## Deployment

 - ### Creation 

    I created this repository by:<br>
    (a) Logging into Github and clicked the green new button.<br>
    (b) This took me to the page below. I selected the code institute template, input a repository name and clicked the green create repository button.<br>

    ![image showing green new button]()
    ![Image showing the create repository page]()

    (c) Opened new repository and clicked green Gitpod button to create a workspace in Gitpod for editing.

  - ### Forking
    (a) To fork my project sign in to Github and go to my [repository]()<br>
    (b) Above and to the right of the settings there are three options and the far right one says Fork, select this.<br>
    (c) The fork is now in your repositories.

    ![Image showing fork button]()

  - ### Clone
    To clone my project sign in to Github and go to my [repository](https://github.com/natalie-kate/music_to_my_ears)<br>
    See [Setting Up Stripe](#setting-up-stripe), [Setting Up Project](#setting-up-app), [Cloudinary]()
    and [Heroku Deployment](#heroku-deploment) for more information about what will be required to run Music to my ears.

    *  Clone using command line 
        +  Next to the green Gitpod button is a button that says code, select this. There is a few options as to how you 
        would like to clone, if you choose https, SSH or Github CLI, select the clipboard icon to copy the URL.
        +  In your workspace that you've created, in the terminal , type git clone, paste the URL and enter.

        ![Image showing the cloning options](docs/readme-assets/readme-images/clone.png)

    *  Desktop Github
        + If you choose to clone by selecting open with desktop Github, it will guide you through the clone with prompts.<br>

    For more information or troubleshooting see the Github documentation 
    [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#about-cloning-a-repository)

- ### Setting Up Project
   
    - Install requirements in terminal using pip3 install, see requirements below. If you have cloned my project you can use   pip3 install -r requirements.txt which will install everything for you.
    
      ![Image showing the requirements]()

    - Create a SECRET_KEY for django to use. I used [Django Secret Key Generator](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) for this. My settings.py file is set up to collect keys from the environment so name your variables accordingly. In github you go into settings from your dashboard and then variables. And add the following. You can complete the rest when you go through these sections. DEVELOPMENT value is set to True. Scope you can set to your repository name meaning its only accessible by that project or you can set it to */* meaning all your repositories can access them. 

        ![Image showing the github variable set up]()

    - Ensure you have requirements.txt file and Procfile. These are required by Heroku so ensure these are pushed to github prior to deployment. Ensure all requirements are saved by using pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

    - If using in development you will need to Run migrations usimg command python3 manage.py makemigrations and then python3 manage.py migrate. To create a superuser in the terminal to get access to admin panel, use command python3 manage.py createsuperuser and fill in details required.


- ### Setting up Stripe
    - Register with stripe [here](https://stripe.com/gb) if you don't already have an account. Didn't activate account as will be using free tier.
    - In dashboard from main menu and then select developers and then API keys. Here you will get the publishable and secret keys. These shouldn't go into version control so add them as variables in your github environment for development and in Config Vars in Heroku if you are deploying this project. 

        ![Image showing the Developer menu]()

    - We are also using webhooks in this project and so below API keys in the menu there is a Webhooks option, click into it and then select add endpoint.

        ![Image showing add endpoint button]()
    
    - You'll be asked for a url, this is your github workspace url with /checkout/wh/ added onto the end. When you deploy to Heroko you'll want to create an endpoint for it also, again with the /checkout/wh/ at the end. You then need to select events you want webhooks for. You can select all events but we only really need payment_intent.succeeded and payment_intent.payment_failed. as this is what we have wrote webhandlers for. Select Add Events and then Add Endpoint.

        ![Image showing add endpoint url]()
        ![Image showing add webhook events]()

    - Now in your new webhook, reveal Signing secret, copy this and this is the value for the STRIPE_WH_SECRET variable in your github settings. When you make a new endpoint for Heroku you will get a another Signing Secret to use.

        ![Image showing Reveal signing secret link]()


- ### Heroku deployment
    - Log in to Heroku, click 'New' and select 'Create New App'. In window give the app a name and choose region closest to you and then click 'Create App'. Then in Resources under Add-ons, select Heroku Postgres.

       ![Image showing the Heroku menu]()
       ![Image showing the Add-on section]()

    - In new app page select settings from menu, click reveal config vars and complete the following, see Stripe and AWS sections for where to get their secret key values. DATABASE_URL will have been pre-filled when you selected Postgres. USE_AWS value is True for when we have set up AWS. SECRET_KEY was generated as before with Django Secret Key generator.
      
      ![Image showing the config vars required]()

    - Next select 'Deploy' from menu, three options of deployment are available. If you select Heroku Git, it gives you step by step of what you need to do.

      ![Image showing the deployment options]()

    - I chose to use Github, so you have to search and connect to your github repository. 
    
    - Click enable automatic deployment, below that in manual deploy section, you can pick and deploy a branch to ensure everything is set up correctly. 

      ![Image showing manual deployment]()
    
    - You will now need to migrate and create superuser as above in Setting Up Project section.
